# PerlinNoise
This project generates Perlin noise, and then calculates Brownian Fractal noise from it. 

### Goals:  
- Fill in the map class to allow for storage of tile maps based on noise
- Perform Brownian Fractal calculations in a thread
- Allow for noise generation of a certain sub-area of noise (e.g., the area (x1, y1, x2, y2))

### Long-term Goals:  
- Have maps on a macro and micro scale? (Game uses)
- Have display function for tile maps (Tiles required)
- Use to generate game world (DF inspiration: Landscape and Water, Forestation, &c.)
